It was between this model and another brand, which I wont name here, and I happy that I selected this one.If you want a cheap ear bud with great passive noise reduction, this is a great option. They seal they create allows for great audio range that greatly exceeds Apple's ear buds and blocks ambient noise.I bought these and designated them to be only for our iPad, which kept them out of my son's backpack and my wife's purse. They are still going, and are in great shape.The value in these is so great that I don't see any advantage in spending more money on ear buds, unless you are ready to spend over $100 for an entry level audiophile product. Even if there are some $40+ pairs out there that might be a little better (and there are many that are much worse), the quality you would gain for the $30+ is pretty insignificant until you start paying $$$ for very high signal to noise ratio--which is a measure of how &#34;clean&#34; the sound is.",

While I thought about buying another pair because of how cheap they are, I saw these Panasonic ones with great reviews and a comparable price ($2-$3 more).These are definitely worth the price.  They have a great fit and come with three different sizes of buds to fit any person's ears.  They are slightly angled from the base of the earbud, so for people who don't like that they won't like these.

    "reviewText": "These were bought because of the high ratings here, but I'm not as impressed as some people were.  The sound is reasonable, not the best I've heard from cheap earbuds, but I'm most unhappy with them insofar as the amount of external sound they let in; perhaps they just don't fit my ear well, but--well, I guess they don't.  I've bought cheap JVC earbuds that I liked a lot more than these.I won't buy these again when the die or get lost.UPDATE Mar 2, 2014:  I've had more time to use these earbuds and have modified my opinion of them.  The sound from them seems, to me, to be essentially flat, with no real emphasis on any part of the audio spectrum, which is desirable (for quality sound), or perhaps with a slight boost at the extremes, the bass and treble (perhaps a de-emphasis of the mid range).  The bass is not muddy, the mid's not overpowering (as mid's tend to be in cheap, crummy, earbuds), and the highs are also clean and detailed (keep in mind this is compared to other earbuds I've used, *not* high-end speaker systems and headphones!)  But these fine tonal qualities only present themselves in a quite place.As such, my original complaint stands, insofar as too much outside sound allowed in.

I won't give them one star since they work (i.e. deliver sound). But the sound is very tinny and distorts very easily if the music volume is at or above street-listening level (as opposed to library-listening level), as well as if your EQ is set to deliver any small amount of bass. Another thing I didn't like: when you move your head while wearing these, or if the very thin cords move against your clothing (e.g. walking or jogging), the cord rattling sound is very loudly transferred to your ears; so much so that it was very distracting.I'm not picky about style so the minimalist design of these Panasonics suits me fine. Another plus for me is that the cord splits and two equal lengths lead to each ear piece, as opposed to a short cord for one side and a longer cord for the other side after the split. But these are very minor pluses. This Panasonic line offers great selection in colors and unbeatable prices.

The noise isolation means nothing to airplane noise and this set required my ipad sound to be turned way up to hear anything.The oddly shaped ear plug is nice, however, and fits so much better than your traditional plug.",

    "reviewText": "These are great earbuds with a decent sound for the price.  Definitely has good bass and clear treble for the most part.  Obviously not the crystal clear audio from some boss or klipsch earbuds but they are great.  I use them to go to the gym and plug in to my bluetooth device, so far they work as expected.  In order to hear the bass stick those suckers deep in your ears, but not too deep, sont want to get hurt haha.",
