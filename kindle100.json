I just need to transfer my music files and books to Cloud and then i can easily access them ,no biggie since I have been doing that .And for 159 + tax , its not bad of a tablet that is well built.Dual core is fast enough for what it can do . The wifi is pretty fast even with only 2 bars , very impressive .Lovely crisp screen.I am actually waiting for the Windows Tablet to improve so I can eventually get  that with work related apps since I  am a windows pc user...( dont know about 8 though)  And when I get a new MacBook Pro then I will get the iPad ...since I am both windows and mac user , I will end up with both devicesHowever I am not an Android user, I tried it but didnt like it so  this is the farthest  of an an Android type hardware I will get. lolSo for now , this Kindle Fire HD will serve its purpose which is  pretty much a toy to me.",

    "reviewText": "I went back & forth between the Kindle Fire HD and an iPad mini. The iPad is significantly pricier, but does more. On the other hand, I already have a laptop for mobile computing, and was already an Amazon Prime member so this provided extra free content in addition to the lower cost. In the end, since what I wanted was something to watch/listen to media while at work the Kindle is the better choice for me. There is a lot of overlap between a Kindle and a tablet, but the Kindle is designed mainly to deliver content, movies, books, music through Amazon and some other sources (public library, etc). If you need to do spreadsheets, word processing, business apps on the go, this is not the best choice. But if you need something to pass the time on a long trip and are already an Amazon customer, in the long run this is the way to go. Great screen, very good speakers for this type of device and a huge media selection. One note though: not all Android apps are compatible. The Kindle uses a custom version unique (i.e. limiting) to Amazon. Difficult (though not impossible) to install apps from Google or other sources except the Amazon store.",

Her book reading wasn't affected, but the games she loves to play seemed to bring on the heat.I called Kindle support, and the response was wonderful.  First they helped me clear the memory and try to load just one book and one game.  We gave that a go, but the overheating continued.So, a week after my first support call, I called again, and they had a brand new Fire on my porch the next day.This one works like a dream, with the brilliant display and responsive controls people have mentioned, and no overheating.  Wireless access is quick and simple, and my wife and I used headphones to watch two one-day movie rentals on a long flight.  Small screen but sharp and bright, so movies look and sound great, even for two.  The display for text in books is very easy on the eyes, which is really important for me.  I wouldn't hesitate to choose this as one's main reader.My criticism is based entirely on quality control issues.  I learned through a quick search that overheating happens with some Fire units. The company's quick replacement policy makes it all tolerable, but I think we consumers shouldn't be the quality test staff.I had the same problem with the Boeing 787 I'd just bought, and that was fixed too.

I am glad to see improvements, for example a calender and camera.I'd like to tell everyone that you do not need t purchase a camera app to activate the camera icon in the Photo's tab. Try taking a photo with the facebook app or saving a photo from web. The icon should hen appear. Remarkable quality for a tablet. I see complaints about the cams location. it is meant for skyping and taking photos of yourself (or with others)I hardly used this when I had an Ipod, but I began downloading books,got amazon prime and now I dont even use my laptop, let alone the Ipod.Im sad to see some apps go. like maxthon browser. It was  a better browser, easier for viewing photos and saving them.....but thats nitpicking. It's a great device. Main focus is books. I think the organization is better than IPads. Movies and books get their own tab. Making them both top features. Ipads you need the Ibooks app and Netflix app. Kindle Fire makes it all easier to access and you dont need a million different apps for it.",

I love the feel of the kindle fire hd, this is my forth kindle and my favorite. Can't wait to get the case tomorrow.  Well worth the money...no its not and iPad....wasn't suppose to be.  The sound..wow did Amazon get this right! Sell your old Kindle and make the switch. Got the hdmi cable and the picture looks great on a 47 inch lg tv. I love the adds, I was able to get a book for a $1! By the way, almost ever kindle, when in sleep mode shows the picture of an author right???  That's an advertisement lol!  I got to use this on a trip across the country...Maryland to Denver and back. The battery life is really good.  I am an Ipad fan, but for the purpose of travel- reading a book or watching a movie while waiting in the airport or in flight- this was perfect.  The best part for me is the size, weight (can be heavey but not terrible) and the screen is truely beautiful. I watched The Grey, which might not be a great movie to watch before flying, however the qaulity of the viewing experience was very good! The battery lasted through the movie and several episodes of a tv show. I'm happy!",

    "reviewText": "I had been thinking of getting a Kindle Fire for over a year but was feeling guilty as I already had a basic Kindle. I was &#34;forced&#34; to buy one when Newsweek went all digital in Jan. 2013. (Thank you, Newsweek!) I made a conscious decision to go with the Kindle Fire over an iPad. I wanted the smaller form factor. The iPad mini had just launched but I've been a tech user for many, many years and have never been a fan of iTunes and the Apple ecosystem. (No, I'm not an Apple hater, I chose an iPhone over an Android phone.) Although I'm not a big movie buff, in recent years, our local movie rental places have been closing so when I did rent movies, I had been streaming them from amazon.

    "reviewText": "I absolutely love my Kindle Fired HD!!  My husband gave it to me for Christmas.  At first I had no idea really what it was and why would he buy this electronic device.  He said that he bought it to make more more efficient.  Well, I took it on business trip and I can honestly say that I am totally sold on it.  It is soo convenient, fits in my purse and everything.  I thought that I would be kinda anxious not having my bulky laptop, but this is perfect for travel, especially if you just need to check email to stay connected to the office.  It is also great, because you have games, videos, music, and other apps at your disposal.  I have several of my magazine and books downloaded, so it is a really great handy tool to have!!!  Definitely a great investment!!!",
